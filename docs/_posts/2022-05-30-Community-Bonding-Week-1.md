I am glad that my project proposal is selected this year of GSoC. The project supplement my previous experience in the model optimization field. I am excited to start exploring and implementing latest tools and techniques for this project with JdeRobot community.

## Preliminaries

During our first official meetings, we started with little introduction about ourself. The mentors then presented the core idea behind the main tools of JdeRobot and what could we get from this project. My project would be challenges because many aspects or results are unknown untils we do the experiments, so it can be categorized into research and development project. I also prepared questions regarding GPU server, evaluation (accuracy and inference), and the contribution approach to the organization, which the mentors answered clearly. We agreed on few points to focus during this week, which I present next.

## Objectives

[x] Familiarize with relevant tools, explore documentations and tutorials.
[x] Complete installation of Behavior Metrics and DeepLearningStudio.
[x] Explore the repositories and identify potential bugs.
[x] Prepare template for blog post
[x] Write the blog for first week of community bonding.


## The execution

I have already worked with Behavior Metrics[1] and DeepLearningStudio [2], which are main focus and will be developed further in this project. I have previous experience in contributing additional model in this repositories with [PR#40](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio/pull/40) and [PR#335](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics/pull/335). 

I followed the Behavior Metrics [tutorial](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/quick_start/tutorial) to familiarize with the tool features, creating new brain and training the model with DeepLearningStudio.

The installation of tools is well supported by Behavior Metrics' [installation guide](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/install/) and DeepLearningStudio's [readme instruction](https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio), which I use for local installation on my personal machine. I also identified potential bugs, which I will discuss in coming meeting.

I adapted this blog [template](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2021-Utkarsh_Mishra/tree/gh-pages), which compatible and suitable for GSoC project reporting. With this post I conclude my first week of GSoC's community bonding period.
